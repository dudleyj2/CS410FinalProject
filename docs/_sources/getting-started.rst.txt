Getting started
===============

This project has been built using a cookiecutter template.

It assumes the use of a virutal environment in order to load
the required modules for the project without altering your
standard configuration.

Python 3 is assumed.  If you are not using Conda, then
virualenv is required.  It will be loaded automatically via
the make command to create the environment.

So... make is also required.

View the Documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To view the documentation

.. code-block:: bash

    (reddit_recommender_bot) $ cd docs
    (reddit_recommender_bot) $ python -m http.server

Or, alternatively, just browse to file:///PROJECT_HOME/docs.

Access the Jupyter Notebooks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There is something a bit strange about jupyter, ipython and virtual
environments.  In order to be able to *use* these notebooks, it's important
to set the "kernel" of the notebook to the virtual environment.  To do this,
you have to set the virtual environment as one of the available kernels.

As shown, execute these commands *from* the virtual environment.  Furthermore,
ensure you've already executed either "make requirements" or "make data".

.. code-block:: bash

    (reddit_recommender_bot) $ python -m ipykernel install --user --name reddit_recommender_bot --display-name reddit_recommender_bot
    (reddit_recommender_bot) $ jupyter-notebook

Then from within Jupyter select the notebooks folder.

When done, to remove the kernel: 

.. code-block:: bash

    (reddit_recommender_bot) $ jupyter kernelspec remove reddit_recommender_bot

Preparation
^^^^^^^^^^^

The Reddit Recommender Bot is a reddit bot.

In order to execute the recommender system, a bot is required.

Values in the src/config.py has to updated with below credentials;

.. code-block:: bash

    username    = 'SecureCondorBot'
    password    = 'YearlyCosmicMoth'
    client_id   = 'Zl5AadA6rXrZJQ'
    client_secret = 'LBxuCo8ofvoP4JLZi-WBn-BPON0'
    user_agent = 'Secure Condor Bot (a16b) v0'
    indexdir = 'data/processed'

If you already have a reddit account, a recommendation request can be done by entering below 3 simple steps;
    1. Open a reddit post
    2. Type the summon request as a direct comment to the post or as a reply to an existing comment.

In order to request a recommendation, a Reddit login is required.

If you do not have a reddit account you can create a new one by;
go to https://www.reddit.com/ and clicking on Signup button.


Execution
^^^^^^^^^

The execution of the recommender requires two ongoing processes.

The first process ingests the data and prepares it for analysis.

The second watches for requests and processes a query.

First, start the indexer:

.. code-block:: bash

    (reddit_recommender_bot) $ python src/indexer.py

Next, start the watcher:

.. code-block:: bash

    (reddit_recommender_bot) $ python src/watcher.py

It migh ask you to install psaw, whoosh and pandas libraries manually (If makefile had failed to install them).
You can use below commands to do that;

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install psaw
    pip install whoosh
    pip install pandas

It's prudent to wait a few minutes for the indexer to ingest a sufficient number of comments.

Then, to initiate a query, access Reddit. 
These credentials can be used to test this bot instead of your own reddit account;
    username: CondorBotTest

    password: SecureCondorBotTest

Navigate to an interesting discussion.  Then post a reply including the bot name as shown:

	/u/SecureCondorBot

The watcher will capture the request and after a couple minutes, respond with a recommendation.
